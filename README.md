# ProcessingStuff
A showcase of some of my experimental Processing sketches.

All graphical assets made by myself (such as models, textures, exported GIFs) in this repository are licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). 

I am currently trying to figure out the most appropriate licence for the code, until then, **it remains protected under copyright** (forking is obviously still allowed).

Please ask for permission before releasing remixes of my sketches outside of forks of this repository.
